<div class="content"> <p>I'm a Loran Scholar at McGill University, where I've taken many computer science classes that don't involve programming and math classes that don't involve equations. For examples of code written at 4 in the morning at a hackathon, visit my <a href="http://github.com/clareification">github</a> profile. For a resume with the projects I actually want potential employers to see, visit my <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/clarelyle">LinkedIn</a> page. </p> <p>In my time at McGill I've had the privilege of working with some amazing organizations, including the university chapter of <a href="http://wusc.ca">WUSC</a>, a national NGO that runs some incredible programs, <a href="http://mchacks.io">this</a> super cool hackathon, and the <a href="http://mcgilltribune.com">McGill Tribune</a>, McGill's best (although I'm slightly biased) student-run newspaper. </p> </div>
