<div class="content"> <p>I'm a McGill Math & CS grad about to start a DPhil in CS at the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. Since I'm between degrees at the moment, I'm teaching computers how to play video games (among other things) at Google Brain, working with <a href="https://twitter.com/pcastr">Pablo Castro</a> and <a href="http://www.marcgbellemare.info/">Marc Bellemare</a>. For examples of code written at 4 in the morning at a hackathon, visit my <a href="http://github.com/clareification">github</a> profile. For a resume with the projects I actually want potential employers to see, visit my <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/clarelyle">LinkedIn</a> page. </p>

 <p>In my time as a Loran Scholar at McGill I had the privilege of working with some amazing organizations, including the university chapter of <a href="http://wusc.ca">WUSC</a>, a national NGO that runs some incredible programs, <a href="http://mchacks.io">this</a> super cool hackathon, and the <a href="http://mcgilltribune.com">McGill Tribune</a>, McGill's best (although I'm slightly biased) student-run newspaper. If you're at McGill right now, you shoulkd definitely check out all three.</p> </div>
