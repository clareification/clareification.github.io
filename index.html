<p>Hello, world!</p>

<p>I'm McGill math and CS grad about to start a DPhil in Computer Science at Oxford. I like to write about math, computer science, and life in general. I've mostly written about science and tech at the <a href="http://mcgilltribune.com">McGill Tribune</a>, but I'm starting to write more mathematically-themed material for this website.</p>
